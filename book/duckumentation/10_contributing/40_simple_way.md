# The simple way to edit the documentation {#duckumentation-contribute-simple status=ready}

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers, in the book itself.

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_1" figure-caption="Click on edit button.">
    <img src="s1.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

They link to the "edit" page in Github. There, one can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_2" figure-caption="You will land on GitHub">
    <img src="s2.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

Do your edits where appropriate.

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_3" figure-caption="Editing the docs.">
    <img src="s3.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

You can check the outcome by clicking on `Preview changes`, note that not all functionalities are visible by the preview. For large changes refer to [](#duckumentation-workflow).

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_4" figure-caption=A preview of the changes.">
    <img src="s4.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

Then after your edits, in the bottom part of the webpage, describe your commit and click on `Propose file change`. When committing, please choose "create branch".  

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_5" figure-caption="Describe and commit.">
    <img src="s5.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

Then, click on `Create pull request`, as you probably don't have rights to push directly.

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_5" figure-caption="Create a pull request.">
    <img src="s6.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
</div>

Again you need to confirm that you want to open the pull request.

<div figure-id="fig:simple_way_7" figure-caption="Confirm a pull request.">
    <img src="s7.png" style='width: 8cm'/>
